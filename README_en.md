## Description
> Submission for the [Visual Novel Jam 2025](https://itch.io/jam/winter-vn-jam-2025)

A Winter of unexpected Love is a visual novel where you follow Kristine; a normal girl, with a normal life. At first it doesn’t seem like it, but as you continue her story you realise that she’s a girl that, although has to undergo surgery and is a patient, she’s also a student. 
You have to help Kristine and make decisions along the game, like what she needs to do before an important surgery or what she needs to reply to that boy she has just met.

There are 6 different endings available. ¡Find them all!
